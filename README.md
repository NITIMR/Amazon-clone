# Amazon-clone
I developed this  Amazon clone project using HTML and CSS is a replication of the popular e-commerce platform Amazon's user interface. This project aims to mimic the visual appearance and layout of the original Amazon website while utilizing only HTML and CSS, without involving any backend or dynamic functionalities.
